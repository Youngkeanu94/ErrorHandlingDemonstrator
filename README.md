This C# program showcases various error-handling techniques. It uses Debug.Assert to validate preconditions, and try-catch blocks to handle different exceptions such as array out-of-bounds, file not found, and divide-by-zero errors. The code attempts risky operations like accessing an array incorrectly, reading a non-existent file, and dividing by zero, each wrapped in a try-catch block to gracefully handle potential exceptions. This program is a practical demonstration of implementing robust error-handling mechanisms in a C# application.
